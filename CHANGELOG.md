## [2.0.0] — Unreleased

A ground-up rewrite of the v1.3.1 pipeline. Legacy YAML configs and
flag-style CLI invocations keep working through a translation layer that
warns once per deprecated spelling — see
[migrating from v1 to v2](https://sterling-group.github.io/ChemRefine/migrating-v1-to-v2/)
for the full map.

### Deprecated

- The v1.3.1 compatibility layer — legacy YAML keys (`calculation_type` aside,
  which already raises), the `mlff*`/`dft` engine spellings, the `sample_type`
  block, and the flag-style CLI (`chemrefine CONFIG --rebuild_cache N`) — is
  scheduled for removal in **3.0.0**. It warns once per rewritten feature today.
  See [migrating from v1 to v2](https://sterling-group.github.io/ChemRefine/migrating-v1-to-v2/).

### Added

- Engine plugin system: a `CalculationEngine` protocol plus a registry, with
  four documented base shapes for new engines (`engines/api.py`). Plugins and
  MLIP backends are **auto-discovered** — a new engine package or backend
  module is dropped in and registers itself, with no central import list to
  edit. Bundled engines: `orca`, `mlip`, `mlip-extopt`, `mlip-train`,
  `pyscf`, `pyscf-extopt`.
- Subcommand CLI — `run`, `resume`, `rerun [step]`, `rerun-errors [step]`,
  `rebuild-cache [step]`, `rebuild-nms [step]` — with documented process
  exit codes per failure class.
- Per-step result cache fingerprinted over the step config **and** the
  parent structures' content; `resume` re-executes only what changed.
  Filter-only (`sample:`) edits refilter cached results without re-running
  calculations.
- Per-step failure policy `on_failure: stop | skip | best` with a
  `failed_jobs.json` ledger; `resume` / `rerun-errors` re-attempt only the
  still-failed structures of a `stop` step.
- Two-round normal-mode sampling (`nms: true`) with target-aware
  displacement (`minimum` / `ts` / `random`) and a reuse fingerprint that
  re-attempts only unresolved parents when search parameters are tuned.
- Shared ExtOpt HTTP server: ORCA optimises on gradients served by an MLIP
  or PySCF backend in the same SLURM job (kernel-assigned ports, health
  probe, clean teardown).
- Per-backend MLIP extras (`mlip-fairchem`, `mlip-mace`, `mlip-sevenn`,
  `mlip-orb`, `mlip-chgnet`) and a backend-agnostic calculator factory. Each
  backend installs into its own dedicated environment (their torch/e3nn trees
  conflict); `[mlip]` defaults to FAIRChem / UMA (`uma-s-1p2`, from upstream
  `fairchem-core >= 2.18` on PyPI).
- Managed backend environments: `chemrefine backends {install,list,path}`
  provisions one env per backend (built with the same tool that created the
  current env — conda / uv / venv) and steps resolve them **by name**, so
  conflicting MLIP stacks (e.g. MACE + UMA) run side by side in one pipeline.
  Every run validates its steps' backends before any job submits.
- SLURM-optional execution: the generated scripts run unchanged under
  `bash` with the same core/GPU throttling, runlogs, and artifacts.
- Opt-in job-array submission (`slurm_array: true`): each step goes out as
  one `sbatch --array` per ≤1000 structures, with the scheduler enforcing
  the `max_cores` budget via the array's `%limit` — large ensembles submit
  in seconds instead of one sbatch call per structure. Outputs, runlogs,
  and recovery behave identically to the per-job path.
- Seeding from a multi-frame `.xyz`, a directory of `.xyz` files (all
  frames), or a CSV of SMILES (deterministic 3D embedding).
- Engineering gates: 100% line+branch test coverage, 100% docstring
  coverage, ruff, mypy, CodeQL, weekly `pip-audit`, and an
  mkdocstrings-rendered API reference.

### Changed

- v2 YAML schema: `engine:` + `operation:` replace `calculation_type`;
  `sample:` replaces `sample_type:`; `nms:` + `options:` replace
  `normal_mode_sampling*`; `executables:` replaces `orca_executable`;
  `input:` replaces `initial_xyz`. Legacy spellings are rewritten with a
  deprecation warning — except `calculation_type`, which raises with a
  pointer to the migration guide.
- `mlff` renamed to `mlip` everywhere (engines, extras, YAML); the old
  spellings remain as aliases.
- The version is single-sourced in `pyproject.toml`; releases are tag-driven
  (a `vX.Y.Z` tag builds, creates the GitHub Release, and publishes to PyPI
  after a tag↔version consistency check).

### Fixed

Hardening landed during the 2.0.0 stabilization:

- The step cache is one plain-JSON document (`_cache/step.json`) instead of
  a pickle — loading a cache can never execute code from the file, and the
  document is directly inspectable. Caches from earlier dev builds rebuild
  automatically.

- Cluster SLURM headers using `--ntasks-per-node` / `--ntasks-per-core` keep
  those directives in generated scripts.
- An ORCA template requesting more `%pal` ranks than `max_cores` is clamped
  to the budget instead of oversubscribing its allocation.
- A typoed `pyscf-extopt` option fails the step instead of silently running
  with defaults.
- Corrupt output files (overflowed coordinate tokens, malformed ensemble
  frames) land in the failed-jobs ledger instead of crashing the run.
- The ExtOpt tensor-dump tag is sanitized before filename use.
- The ExtOpt server requires a per-run bearer token on `/calculate` (written
  `0600` next to `server.url`), so other users on a shared compute node can
  no longer drive it.
